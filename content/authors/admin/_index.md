I am a second year doctoral student in Psychology at the Univeristy of Chicago. I work with Dan Yurovsky at the [Communication and Learning Lab](https://callab.uchicago.edu/) (Carnegie Mellon Univeristy) and Alex Shaw at the [Developmental Investigations of Behavior and Strategy Lab](https://www.dibslab.uchicago.edu/) (University of Chicago). Prior to coming to the University of Chicago, I worked with [Claire Hughes](https://www.cfr.cam.ac.uk/directory/ClaireHughes) at the University of Cambridge and [Jennifer Henderlong Corpus](https://www.reed.edu/psychology/faculty/corpus.html) at Reed College. 

Broadly, I work on the interplay between language and social cognition across development. I am especially interested in emerging conceptions of knowledge and knowledge transmission, and in the language cues that drive children's inferences about knowledge.
