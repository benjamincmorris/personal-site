title: Children hear more about what is atypically true
summary: How do parents describe concepts to their young children? In a corpus analysis, we show they discuss far more atypical features of concepts than typical ones (e.g., kids hear way more talk about carrots that aren't orange, than carrots that are orange).

Child language input reflects atypical more than typical features. More description of typical features early in development may provide a foothold for young learners.
